Issue:  volume control doesn't really change volume but makes the sound muddier at low levels and sounds fine at 100%

I installed pulseaudio-equalizer (qpaeq) to adjust the high frequencies, but realized that it was more a level thing than an EQ thing.
May be related to this computer having 4 speeakers and a "subwoofer" and the sub not being affected by the master volume

Discovered that when running alsamixer and changing the PCM level the volume change as it should without affecting tone.
Some searching brough up https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=91453&p=1639481

The fix:
sudo nano /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-output.conf.common

add this above the [Element PCM] block:
[Element Master]
switch = mute
volume = ignore

Now volume buttons and sliders affect the PCM level rather than the master level and all is good.
